The Dockerfile for this project follows several best practices to create efficient, secure, and minimal Docker containers.

## Minimal Base Image
We're using python:3-alpine3.15 as our base image which is minimal and ideal for python applications. Using a minimal image reduces the attack surface for potential hackers and decreases build times.

## Set Environment Variables
We've set PYTHONUNBUFFERED to 1 to ensure our Python container logs and output come out in realtime without being buffered inside Docker.

## Labels
We added labels to specify metadata that provides important information about the Docker image, such as the version, description, and maintainer.

## Non-root User
We run our application with a non-root user (user) to improve the security of your application. This mitigates the effects of a container breakout.

## Specified Work Directory
We've set an explicit WORKDIR(/app_python). This ensures that the absolute file paths do not rely on expected defaults and adds clarity to users of the Dockerfile.

## Copy Specific Files
We copied only the specific files needed to run the application. This minimizes the image size and prevents sensitive information from being included in the image.

## Package Installations
We're using pip install --no-cache-dir to avoid storing the cache data and hence reduce the size of the image.

## Expose Port
We exposed port 8080 to allow communication with the application.

## CMD Instruction
We've used CMD instruction for running the application. This is because CMD instructions provide defaults for an executing container, which can include an executable, or they can omit the executable, in which case you must specify an ENTRYPOINT instruction. 

## Conclusion
We've implemented a number of Docker Best Practices in our Dockerfile to make it as efficient, secure, and user-friendly as possible. These practices help to ensure that our Docker images are well-optimized for deployment in any environment.
